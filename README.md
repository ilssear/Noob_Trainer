Noob trainer for Wesnoth

This add-on is based on Ravana's XP Modification (https://github.com/ProditorMagnus/XP_Modification, https://r.wesnoth.org/t39116).
It provides a right-click menu that allows you to spend unit experience for upgrades. The costs in XP can be changed during game creation.

It also adds a Noob upgrade option that provides 100 hitpoints, 10 movement and 2 strikes for a minimum of 0 XP.

Noob trainer is a continuation of XP Modification and XP Era.
